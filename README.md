# Sort-and-Search-Visualizer
Through a simple and user-friendly interface, we can input custom arrays and watch as the algorithms process the data step by step, giving us a clear understanding of how each algorithm works. The visualizer employs real-time updates and colorful animations to highlight the sorting and searching processes, making complex concepts easy to grasp.

Key Features:
<br>
<br>

-> It is a Real-Time Visualizations of Sorting and Searching Algorithms.
<br>
->Adjust the speed of the visualizations to suit our learning pace, from slow motion to faster execution.
<br>
->Each step of the algorithm is color-coded to highlight the key operations, such as comparisons, swaps, and identified elements.
<br>
->It is a Algorithms Selector like bubble sort,merge sort and many more.
